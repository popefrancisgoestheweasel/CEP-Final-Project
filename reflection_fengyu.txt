This project was the largest-scale programming task I have ever taken on. As such, I underestimated many areas of it. Due to the looming EOYs during most of the time we were supposed to be working on the project, we decided to start mainly only after EOYs. However, I learnt that leaving things to the last minute is not always the best strategy - we ended up almost not finishing our app, and we had to cut a few features out partly due to the lack of time. Planning is key - perhaps we should have planned to complete some of the lighter element in between preparing for EOYs in order to prevent such rushed conditions again.
A major takeaway for me is how much effort goes into coding a simple app. Our app is not very complicated, but it required a lot of research and just trying non-stop to be able to achieve what we wanted. In the process, I have learnt a lot more about using Django using this hands-on experience. It was definitely an enriching experience for me.
