Over the course of the completion of this project I have had many takeaways — both with regard to work ethic as well as with regard to programming.

Firstly, the use of Django in the project has helped me understand the importance of the existence of frameworks in web development. Although I have made use of jQuery in web design before, the reality of how significant a role frameworks like Django play in web development sunk in much deeper throughout this project, as I came to appreciate how much coding time is saved through using the pre-existing frameworks. Furthermore the use of said frameworks, like Django, greatly reduces the would-be steep learning curve when it comes to back-end web development.

I have also learned about the importance of planning and work ethic when it comes to programming. When faced with a large task like designing a website from scratch, one must be careful 1) not to over-commit and 2) to allocate more than sufficient time for development. Throughout the process of my team’s development of our website we committed to a task that was perhaps past our current skill level, and did not have enough planning with regard to the back-end development of our website; these are both areas that I will seek to improve upon in future work.
